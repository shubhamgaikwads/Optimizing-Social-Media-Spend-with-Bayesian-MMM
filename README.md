# Social Media Marketing Mix Model with Bayesian PyMC
This repository demonstrates the use of a Bayesian Marketing Mix Model (MMM) with PyMC to optimize marketing spend across social media platforms.

# Introduction

This project aims to help marketers understand the impact of social media marketing spend on key business metrics such as sales or revenue. Using Bayesian methods implemented with PyMC, we estimate the effects of spending across various social media channels (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok) and offer insights into optimal budget allocation. Additionally, we provide functions to calculate optimal marketing spend based on various factors like content type and target audience.


# Install required packages
pip install pymc arviz pandas numpy matplotlib


# Dependencies

pandas: Data manipulation
numpy: Numerical operations
matplotlib: Data visualization
arviz: Analysis and visualization for Bayesian data
pymc: Bayesian probabilistic programming

# Usage

To use the Bayesian model to optimize marketing spend, follow these steps:

Build the Bayesian Model: Create a Bayesian model with PyMC to estimate the impact of marketing spend across various social media platforms. This step involves setting up the model, sampling from the posterior distributions, and deriving the necessary coefficients.
Calculate Optimal Spend: With the Bayesian model, calculate optimal marketing spend based on given inputs such as budget, content type, and target audience.
Example code snippets and detailed explanations are provided in the repository, showing how to build the model, sample from it, and calculate the optimal spend.

# Results

The results from the Bayesian Marketing Mix Model provide insights into the impact of different marketing channels on business outcomes. By calculating the posterior distributions of model parameters, we can understand how various factors influence revenue or sales.

Posterior Coefficients: The summary statistics from the Bayesian model indicate the estimated impact of each social media channel on revenue.
Optimal Spend: The calculated optimal spend provides suggestions for how to allocate a given marketing budget based on the derived coefficients and various adjustments for content type and target audience.

# Summary

The Bayesian Marketing Mix Model built with PyMC allows marketers to analyze and optimize social media marketing spend. The model's coefficients and resulting optimal spend calculations offer valuable insights into how different channels impact key business metrics. By incorporating adjustments for content type and target audience, this project helps businesses make data-driven decisions about marketing budget allocation.
